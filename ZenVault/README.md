Usage Instructions
TEE Plugins
Key Derivation:
Derive secure keys for blockchain operations.
javascript

import { deriveSecureKey } from "./TEE/deriveKeyProvider.js";

const key = await deriveSecureKey("/path/to/derive", "subject-identifier");
console.log("Derived Key:", key);
Remote Attestation:
Generate attestation reports for trusted environments.
javascript
复制代码
import { generateRemoteAttestation } from "./TEE/remoteAttestationProvider.js";

const attestation = await generateRemoteAttestation("custom-report-data");
console.log("Attestation Report:", attestation);
Webhook Plugins
Create a Webhook:

javascript

import { createWebhook } from "./Webhooks/createWebhook.js";

await createWebhook(runtime, "solana", "transfers", "https://example.com/notification");
List Registered Webhooks:

javascript

import { listWebhooks } from "./Webhooks/listWebhooks.js";

const webhooks = await listWebhooks(runtime);
console.log(webhooks);
